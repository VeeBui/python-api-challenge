## WeatherPy
A script to analyse weather trends for 1500 different cities, as the latitude approaches the equator. Max Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness and Wind Speeds are looked at.

Each variable has three graphs plotted, found in /output_data/  

- Latitude vs Variable
- Latitude vs Variable (Northern Hemisphere with trend line)
- Latitude vs Variable (Southern Hemisphere with trend line)

Each variable also has some text analysis of the trends evident after plotting.  
This solution can be found at WeatherPy.ipynb

## VacationPy
A script to pick out ideal cities to visit based on desired parameters. The nearest hotel to each city's specified lat/lon has been located - within 10000m. Each city has been plotted on an interactive map, with humidity being shown by marker size. The closest hotel found is visible by hovering over the marker.
